				We present AutoMerge, a LiDAR data processing framework for assembling a large number of map segments into a
				complete map. Traditional large-scale map merging methods are fragile to incorrect data associations, and are
				primarily limited to working only offline. AutoMerge utilizes multi-perspective fusion and adaptive loop 
				closure detection for accurate data associations, and it uses incremental merging to assemble large maps from
				individual trajectory segments given in random order and with no initial estimations. Furthermore, after 
				assembling the segments, AutoMerge performs fine matching and pose-graph optimization to globally smooth the 
				merged map. We demonstrate AutoMerge on both city-scale merging (120km) and campus-scale repeated merging 
				(4.5km x 8). The experiments show that AutoMerge (i) surpasses the second- and third- best methods by 14% and
				24% recall in segment retrieval, (ii) achieves comparable 3D mapping accuracy for 120 km large-scale map assembly,
				(iii) and it is robust to temporally-spaced revisits. To the best of our knowledge, AutoMerge is the first 
				mapping approach that can merge hundreds of kilometers of individual segments without the aid of GPS.

			  This paper studies a planar multiplayer Homicidal Chauffeur reach-avoid differential game, where each pursuer is a Dubins car 
			  and each evader has simple motion. The pursuers aim to protect a goal region cooperatively from the evaders. Due to the 
			  high-dimensional strategy space among pursuers, we decompose the whole game into multiple one-pursuer-one-evader 
			  subgames, each of which is solved in an analytical approach instead of solving Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equations. For each 
			  subgame, an evasion region (ER) is introduced, based on which a pursuit strategy guaranteeing the winning of a simple-motion 
			  pursuer under specific conditions is proposed. Motivated by the simple-motion pursuer, a strategy for a Dubins-car pursuer 
			  is proposed when the pursuer-evader configuration satisfies separation condition (SC) and interception orientation (IO). 
			  The necessary and sufficient condition on capture radius, minimum turning radius and speed ratio to guarantee the 
			  pursuit winning is derived. When the IO is not satisfied (Non-IO), a heading adjustment pursuit strategy is proposed, 
			  and the condition to achieve IO within a finite time, is given. Then, a two-step pursuit strategy is proposed for the SC and 
			  Non-IO case. A non-convex optimization problem is introduced to give a condition guaranteeing the winning of the pursuer. 
			  A polynomial equation gives a lower bound of the non-convex problem, providing a sufficient and efficient pursuit 
			  winning condition. Finally, these pairwise outcomes are collected for the pursuer-evader matching. Simulations are provided 
			  to illustrate the theoretical results.

				Recent years have witnessed the increasing application of place recognition in various environments, 
				such as city roads, large buildings, and a mix of indoor and outdoor places. This task, however, still remains 
				challenging due to the limitations of different sensors and the changing appearance of environments. 
				Current works only consider the use of individual sensors, or simply combine different sensors, ignoring the 
				fact that the importance of different sensors varies as the environment changes. In this paper, an 
				adaptive weighting visual-LiDAR fusion method, named AdaFusion, is proposed to learn the weights for 
				both images and point cloud features. Features of these two modalities are thus contributed differently 
				according to the current environmental situation. The learning of weights is achieved by the attention branch 
				of the network, which is then fused with the multi-modality feature extraction branch. Furthermore, 
				to better utilize the potential relationship between images and point clouds, we design a twostage fusion approach 
				to combine the 2D and 3D attention. Our work is tested on two public datasets, and experiments show that 
				the adaptive weights help improve recognition accuracy and system robustness to varying environments.

				Merging multiple maps is necessary when the task of mapping a large area is divided and assigned to 
				different robots. Unlike scanned or reconstructed models, point cloud maps built by SLAM are usually
				sparser and contain much noise, making current global registration methods failed. In this paper, we 
				focus on the global registration of point cloud maps which have low-overlap regions and no prior 
				relative transformation between each other, so that maps can still be merged in GPS-denied environment. 
				Our method adopts a pipeline of feature matching, where key points are first selected evenly within voxel 
				grids and then used for getting feature descriptors. After matching for correspondences, a RANSAC based 
				registration gives the rough transformation between maps, which can further be refined by ICP. To improve
				the accuracy of correspondences, we specifically introduce a keypoint clustering and classification method.
				Except for 3D point cloud maps as inputs, no other information is needed. Experiments on the campus show 
				that our approach successfully deals with large area with similar structures.

				This paper considers a one-defender-one-attacker reach-avoid differential game (DG) in the plane which is split by a 
				straight line into a goal region and a play region. The attacker aims at entering the goal region from the play region 
				without being captured, while the defender tries to capture the attacker in the play region. We focus on the defense 
				problem where the defender is a Dubins car and the attacker is a simple-motion model. First, a controller is proposed 
				for the defender to track a reference heading which is derived from an evasion space (ES)-based defense strategy. 
				Then,  an upper bound for the time derivative of the reference heading is computed. Based on it, we show that the 
				defender can succeed to track the reference heading within a finite time. Finally,  both simulation and experiment 
				examples are provided, where a vision-based re-localization method is used for the experiment to deal with the 
				coordinate inconsistency problem.

				Pursuit-evasion (PE) differential games are widely studied due to their enormous application prospects in robotics. 
				Most of current works, however, focus on the theory and simulation, while even for some experiments the global 
				information is directly acquired by external devices or just by sharing, which is far from the real scenarios. Motivated 
				by this limitation, we propose a LiDAR-inertial based localization and perception method to estimate robot states 
				such as position, pose and velocity required by high-level strategies. The LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) that utilizes 
				data from 3D LiDAR and IMU provides self localization in an unknown environment. To locate other robots, a curve 
				fitting based algorithm for 3D LiDAR point clouds is proposed, after which a sliding window average method is 
				adopted to filter the noise in the perception results. Except for 3D LiDAR and IMU, no other sensors or communication 
				is needed. Experiments are presented to illustrate the results.

				Nowadays plenty of pointer meters are used in the field of chemical industry and electrical power system. To avoid 
				reading their indication manually, many algorithms based on computer vision have been proposed to read pointer meters 
				automatically. These methods, however, are limited to meters whose scales are uniform, and their accuracy is vulnerable to 
				the error in the recognition of a meter's center. In this paper, a novel automatic reading algorithm of pointer meters based on 
				scale seeking is proposed to overcome the weaknesses of the existing methods. Differing from the popular angle-based 
				methods, we obtain the indication of the meter by comparing the distances between the peak of pointer and its nearest scales. The 
				position and values of all scales can be automatically acquired and inferred by using our scale seeking and value inference 
				algorithms, which is independent of any prior information in a database. Experiments prove that the algorithm can be applied 
				to both meters with uniform or non-uniform scales effectively.
