				This paper considers a one-defender-one-attacker reach-avoid differential game (DG) in the plane which is split by a 
				straight line into a goal region and a play region. The attacker aims at entering the goal region from the play region 
				without being captured, while the defender tries to capture the attacker in the play region. We focus on the defense 
				problem where the defender is a Dubins car and the attacker is a simple-motion model. First, a controller is proposed 
				for the defender to track a reference heading which is derived from an evasion space (ES)-based defense strategy. 
				Then,  an upper bound for the time derivative of the reference heading is computed. Based on it, we show that the 
				defender can succeed to track the reference heading within a finite time. Finally,  both simulation and experiment 
				examples are provided, where a vision-based re-localization method is used for the experiment to deal with the 
				coordinate inconsistency problem.

				Pursuit-evasion (PE) differential games are widely studied due to their enormous application prospects in robotics. 
				Most of current works, however, focus on the theory and simulation, while even for some experiments the global 
				information is directly acquired by external devices or just by sharing, which is far from the real scenarios. Motivated 
				by this limitation, we propose a LiDAR-inertial based localization and perception method to estimate robot states 
				such as position, pose and velocity required by high-level strategies. The LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) that utilizes 
				data from 3D LiDAR and IMU provides self localization in an unknown environment. To locate other robots, a curve 
				fitting based algorithm for 3D LiDAR point clouds is proposed, after which a sliding window average method is 
				adopted to filter the noise in the perception results. Except for 3D LiDAR and IMU, no other sensors or communication 
				is needed. Experiments are presented to illustrate the results.

				Nowadays plenty of pointer meters are used in the field of chemical industry and electrical power system. To avoid 
				reading their indication manually, many algorithms based on computer vision have been proposed to read pointer meters 
				automatically. These methods, however, are limited to meters whose scales are uniform, and their accuracy is vulnerable to 
				the error in the recognition of a meterâ€™s center. In this paper, a novel automatic reading algorithm of pointer meters based on 
				scale seeking is proposed to overcome the weaknesses of the existing methods. Differing from the popular angle-based 
				methods, we obtain the indication of the meter by comparing the distances between the peak of pointer and its nearest scales. The 
				position and values of all scales can be automatically acquired and inferred by using our scale seeking and value inference 
				algorithms, which is independent of any prior information in a database. Experiments prove that the algorithm can be applied 
				to both meters with uniform or non-uniform scales effectively.
